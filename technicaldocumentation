# MDM Migrator Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

MDM Migrator is built on a modular architecture designed to handle enterprise-level MDM migrations securely and efficiently. The application uses Swift and SwiftUI for its implementation, following Apple's latest development guidelines and security practices.

### Core Components

The application is structured into several key services that work together to manage the migration process:

#### PrivilegedService
This service handles all operations requiring root privileges. It manages system-level operations through a LaunchDaemon, ensuring secure execution of privileged commands. The service implements proper privilege separation and secure command execution patterns.

Key implementations:
```swift
func executeCommand(_ command: String, requireRoot: Bool = true) async throws -> String {
    // Secure command execution with privilege checks
    // Error handling and logging
    // Output sanitization
}
```

#### MigrationService
The central orchestrator for the migration process. It coordinates between different components and manages the overall flow of the migration. This service implements state management and progress tracking.

State management example:
```swift
enum MigrationStatus: Equatable {
    case notStarted
    case inProgress(progress: Int)
    case completed
    case failed(Error)
}
```

#### NotificationService
Handles user notifications and system alerts throughout the migration process. This service ensures users are informed of important events and required actions.

### Security Implementation

#### Root Privilege Management
The application uses a LaunchDaemon for privileged operations. This implementation ensures secure handling of root privileges while maintaining proper security boundaries.

LaunchDaemon configuration:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.mdmmigrator.daemon</string>
    <!-- Additional configuration -->
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Migration Process Implementation

#### Phase 1: Prerequisites Check
The application performs comprehensive system validation before proceeding with migration:

```swift
func checkPrerequisites() async throws {
    // Verify system version
    // Check network connectivity
    // Validate Jamf enrollment
    // Verify available disk space
    // Check administrative privileges
}
```

#### Phase 2: Jamf Removal
Secure removal of existing Jamf management:

```swift
func removeJamfManagement() async throws {
    // Profile removal
    // Framework cleanup
    // Verification steps
    // Error handling
}
```

#### Phase 3: Intune Enrollment
Automated enrollment in Microsoft Intune:

```swift
func enrollInIntune() async throws {
    // Deploy Company Portal
    // Initialize enrollment
    // Monitor progress
    // Verify completion
}
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

The application implements comprehensive error handling:

```swift
enum MigrationError: LocalizedError {
    case prerequisitesFailed(String)
    case jamfRemovalFailed(String)
    case intuneEnrollmentFailed(String)
    // Additional error cases
}
```

Error recovery procedures are implemented for each major operation, ensuring graceful handling of failures and proper system state maintenance.

### Logging System

Comprehensive logging is implemented throughout the application:

```swift
class Logger {
    func info(_ message: String)
    func error(_ message: String)
    func warning(_ message: String)
    // Additional logging methods
}
```

Logs are stored at:
- `/var/log/mdmmigrator.log`
- `/var/log/mdmmigrator.error.log`

### Performance Considerations

The application is optimized for:
- Minimal system impact during migration
- Efficient resource utilization
- Quick recovery from interruptions
- Smooth UI updates during long operations
